# Five Band Equalizer Project

## Introduction
This project was undertaken during our 3rd semester lab, focusing on the creation of a five-band equalizer. We were provided with specific frequency ranges, leading us to select appropriate filter types for each band. Utilizing an online simulation tool, we determined the required resistor and capacitor values.

## Project Details
- We incorporated amplification for each frequency range, along with an additional amplifier.
- Specific amplification values were assigned to achieve the desired output.
- A non-inverting amplifier was implemented for each filter circuit.

## Visual Output
To provide a visual representation of the loudness of each frequency range, we incorporated 10 LEDs for each band. This setup enables us to display the relative loudness of individual frequency ranges based on the number of illuminated LEDs.

## Tools and Technologies
- Proteus: Used for developing the circuit and simulation.
- Altium: Employed for PCB design.
- Solidworks: Utilized for creating the enclosure.

## How to Use

1. Connect the input sound source using the DC jack provided.
2. Connect your headphones to the output jack for audio playback.
